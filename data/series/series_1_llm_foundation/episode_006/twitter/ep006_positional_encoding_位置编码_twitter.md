ChatGPT is actually "face blind" to word order. Without Positional Encoding, "I love you" and "You love me" mean the same thing to the model. 😱 Why is this the AI's hidden GPS? 🧵

### Tweet 2

Transformants dump text into a "bag" for speed, losing all sequence info. ⚡️ Positional Encoding acts like a hidden ID, injecting "where" into the "what," so the model knows who comes first. 📍

### Tweet 3

Early methods used Sinusoidal functions. Mathematically elegant, but often too rigid for complex learning. 📉 We needed a way to capture *relative* distance, not just absolute numbers. 💡

### Tweet 4

Enter RoPE & ALiBi. Instead of simple labels, they use geometric "rotation" to intuitively understand relative positions. 🔄 This is key to handling long texts in modern LLMs. 🚀

### Tweet 5

From labeling to rotating spacetime, Positional Encoding is the unsung hero behind AI logic. 💯 Which method are you using? Let me know below! 👇
