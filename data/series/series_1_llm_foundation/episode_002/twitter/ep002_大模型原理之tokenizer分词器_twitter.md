### Tweet 1

Why does ChatGPT swear there are only 2 "r"s in "strawberry"? 🤯

### Tweet 2

It's not stupidity, it's a vision problem. Meet the Tokenizer: the invisible gatekeeper of AI that sees the world differently than you do. 🧵

### Tweet 3

Transformer is the "brain," but Tokenizer is the "mouth" and "ears" 👂. Models don't eat text; they eat numbers. Tokenizer slices human language into "Tokens" and translates them into IDs the model understands.

### Tweet 4

It’s a tricky balance ⚖️. Slice too fine (characters) = slow. Too thick (words) = vocabulary explosion. Algorithms like BPE and WordPiece find the perfect middle ground for efficiency.

### Tweet 5

This choice impacts everything:推理速度、知识容量, even cross-language skills 🌐. If the Tokenizer fails, the best logic is useless.

### Tweet 6

Don't underestimate the Tokenizer! It's the first door to LLMs 🚪.
