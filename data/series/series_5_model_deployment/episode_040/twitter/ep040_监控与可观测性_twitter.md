### Tweet 1

Most devs stare at CPU usage for LLM apps. Big mistake! 🚫 Your API returns "200 OK" even when the model hallucinates. Here’s how to actually observe AI in production. 🧵

### Tweet 2

Traditional APM assumes deterministic logic: same input = same output. ✅ But LLMs are probabilistic. That "200 OK" might hide a dangerous hallucination or slow response. 👻

### Tweet 3

Stop just counting memory bytes. ⚡ You need to track Latency, Token costs, and crucially: Quality metrics like Accuracy and Relevance to catch bad outputs. 📊

### Tweet 4

When the model "goes crazy," you need to know why instantly. 🕵️‍♂️ Error tracing and prompt logs turn that "Black Box" into a debuggable data stream for faster fixes.

### Tweet 5

Don't fly your AI app blind. 🛡️ Build a full observability loop now to guarantee stability in production. Follow for more #AI #LLMOps #DevOps tips! 🚀
